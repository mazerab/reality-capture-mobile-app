Forge Reality Capture + React Native

In this repository, We will walk through 'building a basic React Native app' that can handle Forge login so you can process image files on your smartphone through the Forge Reality Capture API and open the resulting viewable in the Forge Viewer.  With the mobile version of Forge Viewer, you can view the resulting Reality Capture OBJ file - think of it as a 3D mesh model of a photoscene that you have captured through pictures taken from your smartphone.

- [x] - Part 1 of this three part demo app series, covers "getting started", "building a mobile UI", and "connecting to Forge Login"

- [x] - Part 2 will focus on creating a Reality Capture backend app running on AWS lambda function that creates a photoscene, upload images to it and process the photoscene. The GitHub repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mazerab/reality-capture-backend-app).

- [x] - Part 3 will focus on creating another AWS lambda function that will be responsible for translating the OBJ output file to SVF format that the Forge Viewer can open. The GitHub repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mazerab/obj-upload-translate-app).
